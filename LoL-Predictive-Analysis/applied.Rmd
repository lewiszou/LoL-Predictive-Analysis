# Creating the Model

We aim to create a model that can potential predict the results of games. Often, analysts declare that gold is a major reason for a victory or loss. They emphasize the importance of gold difference early on â€” however, from our analysis, we have found that gold difference fails to show a major impact. We now create two models; one that predicts based off gold difference at 10 and 15 minutes, and another that predicts based on dragons and barons killed.
