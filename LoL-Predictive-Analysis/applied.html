<h1>Creating the Model</h1>
<p>We aim to create a model that can potential predict the results of games. Often, analysts declare that gold is a major reason for a victory or loss. They emphasize the importance of gold difference early on â€” however, from our analysis, we have found that gold difference fails to show a major impact. We now create two models; one that predicts based off gold difference at 10 and 15 minutes, and another that predicts based on dragons and barons killed.</p>
<!-- Result ~ Gdat10 + Gdat15 -->
<!-- Result ~ Dragons + Barons -->
<!-- Other -->
