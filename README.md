## League of Legends

League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena that allows users to fight in either teams of 3 or 5. Each player, or “summoner”, controls a champion with unique abilities and item builds, setting out to destroy the enemy soul point, the “Nexus”. LoL games are discrete — the progress a player makes in one game does not translate to the next.

League became the most played PC game in Europe and North America in 2012 (by hour). Riot Games, the LoL developer, estimates that over 100 million users play the game each month. With its immense community, League has grown its entertainment and competitive segments. They maintain strong viewership in streaming and video services like Youtube and Twitch.tv, often ranking first in the number of hours watched. This popularity has developed its competitive scene — competitions exist in the United States, Europe, China, South Korea, and more. These seasonal long regional competitions culminate in a playoffs, in which top teams can move on to the annual world championships.

## The World Championships

The League of Legends World Championships brings 16 teams from various regions to compete for the “Summoner's Cup”. In a format similar to that of traditional sports, teams are seeded and drawn into groups. The 2018 finals were watched by nearly 100 million people, a staggering number that reflects the popularity and impact of LoL. Given its worldwide influence, LA2024, the group that oversees Los Angeles' bid for the summer 2024 Olympic Games, would highly consider including eSports and LoL's virtual reality and entertainment in the games.

The 2019 League of Legends World Championship is going on right now, from October 2nd to November 12th.

## About this Project

I used the data from the 2018 World Championships to both analyze important factors that go into the games and see if there was a way to predict the results of games. I applied these results onto the 2016, 2017, and 2019 LoL World Championships. I look forward to applying these models on the 2020 Championships next year.
